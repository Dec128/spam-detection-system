## Project Overview

The Spam Detection System is a comprehensive machine learning-based application designed to accurately classify emails as spam or legitimate (ham) messages. The system employs advanced natural language processing techniques, multiple machine learning algorithms, and adaptive learning capabilities to provide high-accuracy email classification with continuous improvement through user feedback.

### Problem Statement

Email spam continues to be a significant cybersecurity threat, with billions of spam emails sent daily. Traditional rule-based filters are often insufficient against sophisticated spam techniques. This project addresses the need for an intelligent, adaptive spam detection system that can learn from user feedback and improve its accuracy over time.

- Advanced text preprocessing and feature extraction
- Multiple classification algorithms with ensemble methods
- User feedback integration for adaptive learning
- Comprehensive testing and validation framework

   - Advanced tokenization using NLTK
   - Stop word removal with custom spam-specific filters
   - Stemming and lemmatization (NLTK and spaCy support)
   - Batch processing capabilities

2. **Feature Extraction Module** (`modules/feature_extraction.py`)
   - TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization
   - Bag-of-Words count vectorization
   - N-gram feature extraction (1-3 grams)
   - Feature selection using chi-squared test and mutual information
   - Dimensionality reduction and optimization

3. **Classification Module** (`modules/classification.py`)
   - Multiple ML algorithms: Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression
   - Hyperparameter optimization using GridSearchCV
