## Test Results Summary

- **Total Test Cases**: 32
- **Passed**: 30
- **Failed**: 2
- **Success Rate**: 93.75%

## Failed Tests

1. **Large Dataset Processing**: Performance slightly below target (45s vs 30s target)
2. **Permission Error Handling**: File permission error not fully handled in all scenarios

## Recommendations

1. Optimize batch processing for large datasets
2. Improve error handling for file system operations
3. Add more comprehensive edge case testing
4. Implement automated performance monitoring
